# SERIAL MONITOR
To monitor the programs activities while operating, power the NodeMCU via
USB connection to a Linux computer and execute the following: `screen /dev/ttyUSB0 9600,cs8`.
To terminate monitoring, enter: `CNTR-a :quit`.

# TESTING
Some of the test implementation make use of MQTT.
To test the MQTT capabilities, I used a public MQTT broker site
(`broker.mqtt-dashboard.com`) and the Mosquitto client.
Typical test command from your desktop would be:

* `mosquitto_sub -v -h broker.mqtt-dashboard.com -t "Sniffer/#"`
