The [Approximate Library][01] is a WiFi Arduino Library for building proximate interactions
between a WiFi device and a ESP8266 or ESP32.

This library makes it easy to:

* use WiFi signal strength (RSSI) to estimate the physical distance to a device on your home network
* obtain the devices MAC address or IP address
* monitor network activity of these devices
* send a message (e.g. via shared MQTT broker, RESTful API, or ESP-Connect) to a device when your within the device's proximity
